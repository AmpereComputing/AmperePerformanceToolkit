# Contributor Code of Conduct

We, as members, are committed to preserving and fostering a diverse, welcoming community. Below is our community code of conduct, which applies to our repos and organizations, issue trackers, mailing lists, blog content, any other PKB-related communication group, as well as any private communication initiated in the context of these spaces. This code of conduct must be followed by everyone contributing to PKB, regardless of affiliation or position.

Simply put, community discussions should be:

*   respectful, constructive and kind,
*   about features and code, not the individuals involved.
*   treating everyone with respect. Build on each other's ideas. Each of us has the right to enjoy our experience and participate without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or subtle.

Speak up if you see or hear something.
You are empowered to politely engage when you feel that you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing - politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.

Examples of unaccepted behavior include:

* Harassing comments
* Intimidation
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments,
* Personal or political attacks
* Sustained disruption or derailing of threads, channels, lists, etc.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Acknowledgements
This Code of Conduct is based on the Geek Feminism Code of Conduct, the Chromium Code of Conduct and the nodejs Code of Conduct.
