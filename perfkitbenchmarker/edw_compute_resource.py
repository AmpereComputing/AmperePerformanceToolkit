"""Resource representing a compute resource associated with a specific edw service.

This is an abstract resource representing computation resources provisioned for
edw systems. Examples of these resources include Bigquery slot commitments,
Snowflake warehouses, and Redshift clusters. Note that these resources are
computation-only -- no storage is provisioned (except, in some limited cases,
for storage that comes attached to compute units -- such as with Redshift DC2
nodes), and no datasets are configured. In order to run queries, these
additional resources must be pre-provisioned or provisioned in the benchmark.
